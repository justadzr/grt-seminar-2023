# Talks in Geometric Representation Theory Learning Seminar 2023
I participated in the learning seminar on quantum groups and R-matrices organized by Prof. Travis Schedler. The seminar covers various topics, from Yang-Baxter equations, Hopf algebras to classical r-matrices.

In chronological order, my talks are:
* Hopf algebras: I introduced the basic objects and quantization of universal enveloping algebras.
* Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan construction: I introduced the method given by FRT of constructing an h-formal group from a given solution to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation (an R-matrix).
* h-deformation: in the previous talks, the term deformation was never formally defined. In this talk, I formally defined the h-adic topology on C[[h]], topologically free C[[h]] modules, topological tensor products, and h-deformation. I talked about the h-formal groups, being the deformation of formal groups. I also established the correspondence of h-formal groups and h-deformations and stated a version of FRT on R-matrices satisfying the Hecke relation. This version of the theorem is widely used to construct deformations of Kac-Moody algebras. Finally, the talk ends by describing the Lie bialgebra structure induced by deformation and showing the relation between quantum and classical r-matrices.
* Belavin-Drinfeld classification: following the paper *Triangle Equations and Simple Lie Algebras*, I presented the classification of solutions to the classical Yang-Baxter equation with a spectral parameter (elliptic, rational, and trigonometric). I also sketched the proof of classifications of constant r-matrices via a discrete datum (a Belavin-Drinfeld triple) and a continuous datum (a chosen tensor).

## Errata and Comments
Immediately after each talk, I sent a list of errata and comments to the learning group in order to correct the mistakes I made during the talk. I thereby copy-paste the lists here for reference.
